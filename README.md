# NAVIHEALTH:
PSA Code Sprint Hackathon 2024 <br>

## About :blue_book:
NAVIHEALTH is a predictive model that leverages the power of data and AI, to create resilient port operations globally. It has 2 key features: SmartNavigator+ and SmartFleet. 

**1. SmartNavigator+ :robot: [Resilience]** <br>
SmartNavigator+ is an upgraded system incorporates AI predictive analytics to identify potential risks such as geopolitical tension and weather anomalies, before they occur, making it proactive rather than reactive.

**2. Smartfleet :bulb: [Proactive]** <br>
SmartFleet digitally replicates vital port facilities, including quay cranes and AGVs, by utilising sensors and IoT devices to collect real-time data. By incorporating AI health monitoring, machine learning can be employed to proactively predict potential failures before they happen.
